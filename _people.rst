Who Writes the Docs
===================

Technical documentation (see :ref:`taxonomy`) is a responsibility shared across all of Data Management.
Every engineer, manager and scientist ensures that their ideas and creations are written down so that other team members can understand them and contribute to them.
Managers budget time for engineers to create documentation, not just implementations.

Role of the DM Documentating Engineer TechDocs team
---------------------------------------------------

DM members are not alone when documenting their work.
The DataManagement Documenation Engineer is responsible for leading the culture, establishing the practices, and building the infrastructure for technical documentation.
The DM Documentation Engineer is part of the Data Management Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) team under WBS 02C10.5.3.
The DM Documentation Engineer and any effort allocated directly to him or her under WBS 02C10.5.3 is hereafter referred to as the DM TechDocs Team\ [#fn-techdocs]_

.. [#fn-techdocs] DM TechDocs mirrors the Twitter TechDocs team concept, described by Troy Howard in '`Contemporary TechDocs`_.'

While the TechDocs team writes documentation (for its own work, and when needed for important documentation on behalf of other DM teams), the TechDocs team is not the default organization for writing all DM documentation content.
That default is DM subject matter experts: engineers, managers and scientists.
This policy acknowledges DM as an agile organization where a technical writing team simply cannot scale with the engineering effort.
It is more efficient for an engineer to write about what they make while they make it, and for developers to be allowed time to nurture the important skill of producing well-documented software.
Since documentation is continuously delivered (see Platforms), there is opportunity to refine the quality of documentation content.
The role of the TechDocs team is to empower the DM team to produce quality documentation and efficiently as possible.

TechDocs fosters DM documentation best practices in four ways:

- By creating and maintaining platforms for publishing and discovering documentation, and ensuring that DM documentation is citeable by the scientific community  (see :ref:`platforms`).
- By creating and maintaining the tools that convert content into consistently presented websites and artifacts (see :ref:`formats`).
- By helping authors create content that fits into an effective DM-wide information architecture through templates and content strategy.
- By helping authors create documentation with a consistent voice through a style guide and developer education.

Documentation Working Groups
----------------------------

Some documents, and document types, have special working groups that oversee their production.
The organization of these working groups is discussed in the individual sections that describe document classes in the DM Documentation Architecture. Whether explicitly stated or not, the TechDocs team is available to support all DM documentation projects.
