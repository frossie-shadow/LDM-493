Who Writes the Docs
===================

Technical documentation (see :ref:`taxonomy`) is a responsibility shared across all of Data Management.
Every engineer, manager and scientist must ensure that their ideas and creations are written down.
Managers must budget time for engineers to create documentation, not just implementations.

The Data Management TechDocs team
---------------------------------

DM members are not alone when documenting their work.
The Data Management TechDocs team is responsible for leading the culture, establishing the practices, and building the infrastructure for technical documentation.\ [#fn-techdocs]_
The TechDocs team is embedded in, and managed by, the Data Management Science Quality and Reliability Engineering (SQuaRE) team.
TechDocs fulfills WBS TODO.

.. [#fn-techdocs] DM TechDocs mirrors the Twitter TechDocs team concept, described by Troy Howard in '`Contemporary TechDocs`_.'

While the TechDocs team writes documentation (for its own work, and when needed for important documentation on behalf of other DM teams), the TechDocs team is not the default organization for writing all DM documentation content.
That default is DM subject matter experts: engineers, managers and scientists.
This policy acknowledges DM as an agile organization where a technical writing team simply cannot scale with the engineering effort.
It is more efficient for an engineer to write about what they make, while they make it.
Since documentation is continuously delivered (see Platforms), there is opportunity to refine the quality of documentation content.
The role of the TechDocs team is to empower the DM team to produce quality documentation and efficiently as possible.

TechDocs enables DM documentation in four ways:

- By creating and maintaining platforms for publishing and discovering documentation, and ensuring that DM documentation is citeable by the scientific community  (see :ref:`platforms`).
- By creating and maintaining the tools that convert content into consistently presented websites and artifacts (see :ref:`formats`).
- By helping authors create content that fits into an effective DM-wide information architecture through templates and content strategy.
- By helping authors create documentation with a consistent voice by establishing a style guide.

Documentation Working Groups
----------------------------

Some documents, and document types, have special working groups that oversee their production.
The organization of these working groups is discussed in the individual sections that describe document types in the DM Documentation Architecture. Whether stated or not, the TechDocs team is available to support all DM documentation projects.
