Summary
=======

This document defines the Data Management Documentation Architecture: a system for authoring, maintaining, and publishing documentation.
Documentation serves the Data Management System from design, to implementation, and finally to operation.
By specifying management patterns and technologies, the goal of the Data Management Documentation Architecture is to ensure that documentation is available to the DM team and end-users when it is needed, in a format that are useful and appropriate.

The following aspects are covered by the Data Management Documentation Architecture:

- A :ref:`taxonomy of documentation classes <taxonomy>` that each fulfill specific roles.
- A platform for publishing all DM documentation (:ref:`LSST the Docs <publishing-ltd>`) and a platform for searching and browsing all DM documentation resources (:ref:`LSST DocHub <publishing-dochub>`).
- A :ref:`set of documentation formats <formats>` that maintain a consistent reading and discovery experience, while also promoting developer efficiency.
- Policies for organizing the production and maintenance of each class of documentation.
